# Deep Reinforcement Learning Methods for High-Frequency Trading

### Introduction

Reinforcement learning or RL has been a prominent class of methods for solving
sequential problems in different sectors. Reinforcement learning learns dynamics of the
environment by constantly interacting with it and receiving rewards and punishments based
on the actions it takes. 

With the advent of deep neural networks, deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) was introduced which made reinforcement learning more powerful to tackle more
sophisticated problems.

This project employs soft actor-critic (SAC) and  deep Q-networks (DQN) which are the least and the most commonly studied reinforcement learning methods in quantitative finance respectively, to compare their efficiency and profitability. In addition, the project also compares different reward function designs to achieve optimal performance.
